# Single Chain Slide Ring

Perform single-chain slide-ring polymer simulation

1. Initialization of chain conformations with Gaussian distribution
2. Rings are attached to elastic background with tunable virtual chains
3. Random shuffling of number of monobers between rings with Metropolis algorithm based on free energy
4. Ensemble average of stress tensor with Monte Carlo sampling
